Electrical power subsystem (EPS).

• Project description :

read and collect EPS telemetry through sensors (voltage, current and temperature)
send a frame including a telemetry to OBC subsystem through serial interface
receive commands from OBC and execute them
A labview program will be implemented to simulate OBC. -Read EPS telemetry through sensors and send them to OBC -Receive commands from OBC and send acknowledgment.
Configuration:Atmega 2560

1-UART.

2-ADC.

3-Digital I/O.

10 Sensor connected to ADC:

4 Current Sensors. 4 Voltage Sensors. 2 Temperature Sensor.

Implementation:
